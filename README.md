# Climate_Informed_DSS

This project involves developing a Climate Informed Decision Support System (DSS) with the 
following steps: 

**Requirement Analysis**
      Identify key challenges related to climate impact and define system requirements with 
stakeholders to ensure the DSS aligns with organizational goals. 

**Data Collection and Integration** 
      Gather and preprocess data from climate-related factors, operational metrics, and 
stakeholder feedback to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the information used in the 
system. 

**System Development** 
      Develop DSS components for climate impact forecasting, resource management, 
decision-making support, and feedback processing using machine learning and advanced 
analytics. Create a user-friendly interface to facilitate easy interaction and informed decision
making. 

**Testing and Integration** 
      Conduct thorough testing of the system to ensure accuracy and reliability, followed by 
integrating it with existing organizational systems for seamless operation. 

**Implementation and Training** 
      Deploy the DSS, ensuring it is fully functional and accessible, and provide training for 
staff to effectively utilize the system. 

**Continuous Monitoring and Improvement**  
      Monitor system performance, gather feedback, and regularly update the DSS to 
maintain its effectiveness and relevance. 






The project utilizes diverse datasets for disaster prediction, including: 

**Earthquake Data**: Historical and real-time seismic activity data, including 
magnitudes, depths, and locations. Includes features such as magnitude, depth, 
latitude, longitude, etc 

**Flood Data**: Records of past flood events, precipitation levels, and water levels. 
Contains information on monsoon intensity, urbanization, climate change, and flood 
probability. 

**Tornado Data**: Information on tornado occurrences, intensities, and affected areas. 
Features such as magnitude, state, injuries, and fatalities 

**Tsunami Data**: Tsunami records, wave heights, and affected regions. Comprises 
earthquake magnitude, depth, and tsunami intensity.
